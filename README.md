This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project shows how to actually use docker in a production type environment by creating a simple NodeJS App and also how to set up a CI / CD Pipeline Workflow using Github, Travis CI, and Amazon Web Services, creating a pipeline that automatically deploys code every time you push your latest changes to Github.
